For example, If I went to Japanese town in the city, I prefer to have Japanese food. Sometimes when I got there, there was a long queue. What I usually do is that I will drive to nearby Japanese restaurants that may have no or fewer waiting time.  In order to do so, I have to know which area has the most Japanese restaurants. If one is full I still have other choices. "
